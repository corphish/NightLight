🌈 KCAL FOR THE WIN! 🌈
KCAL is a display driver tuning feature for Qualcomm devices, written by savoca. This is used by Night Light to adjust blue light by manipulating screen RGB. Since the changes are done in driver level, this is THE MOST efficient blue light filter, with the changes being visible all over the screen anytime.
